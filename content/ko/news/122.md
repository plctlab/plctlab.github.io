As open-source technologies rapidly advance worldwide, RISC-V has become one of the three major instruction set architectures, known for its openness and flexibility. It is increasingly recognized as a key direction for academic research and industrial innovation. From operating systems to compilers, the RISC-V ecosystem is continuously expanding, offering unprecedented opportunities for researchers and students to innovate. Against this backdrop, PLCT Lab—an active contributor to the international RISC-V community and a driving force in global ecosystem development—warmly invites universities to participate in the “RISC-V Campus Tour” initiative. Together, we aim to promote RISC-V technology across Chinese universities and foster the next generation of open-source talent.
