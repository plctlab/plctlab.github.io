RISC-V devices often lack dedicated GPUs or suffer from unavailable GPU drivers, which means they can only use Softpipe. However, Softpipe’s frame rate is limited to 5 frames per second, causing many graphical programs to function poorly. This is where LLVMpipe’s JIT (Just-In-Time) graphics rendering capability becomes crucial. Let’s explore what LLVMpipe is, what ORCJIT is, its significance, and the recent developments related to RISC-V support.
