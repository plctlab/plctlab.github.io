On February 27, 2025, the RISC-V Day Tokyo 2025 Spring concluded successfully in Tokyo, Japan. Jingkun Zheng, the project leader of the RISC-V OS Support Matrix, delivered a presentation titled "RISC-V Board and OS Support Matrix: A Comprehensive Resource for RISC-V Developers." In his talk, he detailed the open-source compatibility support matrix for RISC-V development boards and operating systems. As part of the RuyiSDK full-stack development environment, this matrix systematically integrates hardware adaptation information and community collaboration mechanisms, supported by metadata analysis and visualization tools. It effectively lowers the barriers for developers in hardware selection and accelerates the deployment process of RISC-V ecosystem applications.
