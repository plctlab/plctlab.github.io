At this week's offline exchange event organized by the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, colleagues from the PLCT laboratory testing team demonstrated how to use the toolchain integrated with RuyiSDK to run the DeepSeek R1 Distill model on the Milk-V Pioneer Box equipped with the SG2042 processor, successfully accelerating it using the XTheadVector extension. This indicates that all chip modules/development boards supporting the XTheadVector (including RVV0.7.1) extension (such as TH1520/Milk-V Meles) can more fully utilize hardware computing power when running large models like DeepSeek.
