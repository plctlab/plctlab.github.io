RISC-V is a next-generation open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that is revolutionizing the global chip industry. With its streamlined design, modularity, and high scalability, RISC-V offers developers unprecedented flexibility and has become a foundational pillar of future computing. As a champion of open standards, XuanTie has been deeply involved in RISC-V innovation, collaborating with universities, enterprises, and the open-source community to advance the ecosystem. Over the years, the XuanTie RISC-V Institute has empowered developers through a series of courses that provide a comprehensive understanding of RISC-V trends, real-world applications, and the full spectrum of knowledge from theory to practice.

Now, in partnership with the PLCT Lab, XuanTie proudly presents a new course series built on their joint research achievements in the RISC-V domain. The curriculum features three intermediate-level courses and two advanced modules, taught by a team of over ten PLCT star developers, seasoned engineers, and XuanTie technical experts. These instructors bring hands-on experience in RISC-V software ecosystems, compiler development, and toolchain optimization, and have contributed to several key RISC-V technologies.
