To address performance loss issues, the XuanTie team from DAMO Academy proposed a new addressing mode called Relax-extend Addressing Mode. In collaboration with the PLCT Lab at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, they jointly released the industry's first RISC-V RV64ILP32 production-grade open-source toolchain (RV64ILP32 toolchain) and Linux kernel. The RV64ILP32 solution fully leverages the computational advantages of 64-bit hardware, significantly improving the overall performance of embedded systems, marking a critical milestone in the transition of embedded processors from 32-bit to 64-bit.
