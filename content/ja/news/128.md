On October 24, 2025, the “RISC-V Campus Tour” was successfully held at Beijing Institute of Technology, Zhuhai. Centered on the development and practical application of the RISC-V open-source ecosystem, the event brought together experts, scholars, and students to engage in in-depth discussions on cutting-edge RISC-V technologies, learning paths, and industrial applications—collectively experiencing the power of open source.

Yanling Yang, Community Operations Manager at PLCT Lab and openGauss RISC-V SIG, opened the session with a talk titled *“Understanding RISC-V from 0 to 1: Development Overview and Ecosystem Progress.”* She outlined RISC-V’s journey from academic origins to global industrial adoption, highlighting its openness, modular design, and efficiency. Through data on chip vendor strategies and developer community activity, she showcased the thriving global RISC-V ecosystem. For students, she offered a practical entry path—from foundational learning resources to ways of contributing to the community—empowering beginners to evolve from “understanding” to “creating.”
