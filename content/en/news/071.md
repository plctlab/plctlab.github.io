Recently, as an important part of the RuyiSDK RISC-V operating system support plan, RevyOS successfully added KVM virtualization support based on OpenSBI-H to the TH1520 processor platform. This support is based on software virtualization technology, which simulates hardware resources through software, enabling efficient operation of multiple virtual machines on the same physical machine. It has already been initially verified on the Milk-V Meles and Sipeed Lichee Pi 4A development boards. This breakthrough marks an important step for the RISC-V ecosystem in the field of high-performance virtualization, providing more possibilities for multi-environment, cloud-native deployment, and edge computing scenarios.
