## 008 [This Month in PLCT (September 1, 2022)](https://plctlab.org/reports/2022-09-01.html)

Wei Wu, et. al., 2022.9.1

Get up-to-date on what we have been up to in the past month!

## 007 [Roadmap of the PLCT Lab in 2022](https://plctlab.org/PLCT-Roadmap-2022.en.html)

Wei Wu, 2022.1.19

This is the roadmap of the PLCT Lab in 2022.

## 006 [How to use krypoto extension with GNU toolchain](https://plctlab.org/k-ext/how-to-build-scalar-cryptography-gnu-toolchain.html)

Jiawei, 2021.5.20

This is the way of how to compile and checkout the scalar cryptography extension with toolchain, which is the sub ISA of RISC-V.

## 005 [Roadmap of the PLCT Lab in 2021](https://plctlab.org/PLCT-Roadmap-2021.html)

Xinyi Li, 2021.1.12

This is the roadmap of the PLCT Lab in 2021, which is about our 2021 plan in the direction of RISC-V development tool.

## 004 [Open Wishlist for RISC-V 2021](https://plctlab.org/events/RISCV-Open-Wishlist-2021.html)

Wei Wu, 2020.11.30

The PLCT Lab is inviting everyone inside the RISC-V community to write to us the dev-tools or orther softwares you wish to have in the RISC-V ecosystem.
Feel free to open an issue or PR and describe the tools you want.

## 003 [Create a minimal Android system for RISC-V](https://plctlab.org/aosp/create-a-minimal-android-system-for-riscv.html)

Chen Wang, 2020.11.24

After a period of hard work, we can now run an Android "minimal system" on QEMU of RISC-V.

The blog is a brief summary of the current work. Although the road ahead is still long, there is something to have a look.

## 002 [Building instruction and test of BishengJDK11 on HiFive Unleashed](https://plctlab.org/openjdk/Building_instruction_and_test_of_BishengJDK11_on_HiFive_Unleashed.html)

Dingli Zhang, 2020.11.20

BishengJDK 11 now brings the template interpreter and backends of C1/C2 compiler to the RISC-V world. We supports RV64G (G used to be represent the IMAFD base and extensions of RISC-V ISA) with BV (bit-manipulation and vector extensions) on the way, and the compressed instructions are out of plan.

This test is to build the JDK on RISCV64 and start to do some benchmark on HiFive Unleashed.

## 001 [Optimize OpenCV for RISC-V](https://plctlab.org/opencv/Optimize_OpenCV_for_RISC-V.html)

Yin Zhang, 2020.11.16

This is a Google Summer of Code project participated by Yin, a graduate student of PLCT lab. We adds a back-end implementation based on RISC-V vector extension for OpenCV in this project. This blog introduced the project and how to build and use it.

## 000 For our staff, graduates, and interns:

- This repo is hosting English blogs only. Chinese blogs should PR to [PLCT-Weekly](https://github.com/isrc-cas/PLCT-Weekly).
- Do not write contents in this README file. Always create a new markdown file for your article.
- ALL file path should not be moved or renamed. We need to keep all links available in future 10 years.
- ALL filenames should be ASCII w/o spaces.
- feel free to create new subfolder if you have a series of blogs to write.
- Put the new blog on the top of index.
